# PowerShell Wizard — Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 0. Overview

The **Teams Squared Enrollment Wizard** is a **PowerShell-based CLI tool** distributed to contractors as part of a bundled `.exe` installer (see bundling SRS). It runs locally on Windows 10/11 devices and performs all steps required to enroll a contractor device:

1. Validate environment (prechecks).
2. Fetch pre-assigned `deviceName` and policies from backend API (`config.json` + JWT).
3. Rename PC, reboot, and resume.
4. Enroll in Miradore MDM.
5. Install Bitdefender GravityZone agent.
6. Apply Windows-specific policies.
7. Report progress/errors back to backend (`/enroll/log`, `/enroll/error`, `/enroll/complete`).

The wizard must:

- Persist state across reboots via `state.json`.
- Log both to local log files and the backend.
- Prompt the user for confirmation before cancellation.
- Handle Ctrl+C gracefully.
- Default to CLI mode, with UI deferred to v2.

    logs\
      wizard-YYYYMMDD.log # Local append-only log
  assets\
    OnlineClientInstaller_teamssquared.msi
    epskit_x64.exe
```

---

## 2. Config.json structure

Generated by API, downloaded with installer:

```json
{
  "apiBase": "http://localhost:5000",
  "enrollmentDeviceId": "ckz123...",
  "jwt": "<24h single-use token>",
  "expiresAt": "2025-09-04T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

---

## 3. State.json structure

Maintained locally for reboot/resume:

```json
{
  "deviceId": "ckz123...",
  "deviceName": "TS2-Sam-0005",
  "currentStage": 2, // Last started stage
  "completedStages": [1], // Stages completed successfully
  "cancelled": false,
  "lastError": null
}
```

---

## 4. Stage Runner (enroll.ps1)

### 4.1 Responsibilities

- Load `config.json` and `state.json`.
- Register Ctrl+C handler:

  - On interrupt → prompt `"Are you sure you want to cancel enrollment? (y/n)"`.
  - If yes → POST `/enroll/error` with `errorMessage="Manually terminated"`, `lastErrorStage=<current>`, set `state.cancelled=true`, exit.

- At each stage:

  - Log start → `/enroll/log` and local file.
  - Execute script.
  - If success → log completion, mark stage in `state.json`.
  - If error → POST `/enroll/error`, persist message to `state.json`, exit.

- If stage is Rename (2) → schedule resume task, reboot.

### 4.2 Local logging

- Local logs are plain text with JSON lines:

  ```
  {"timestamp":"2025-09-03T10:00:00Z","stage":1,"level":"INFO","message":"Internet OK"}
  {"timestamp":"2025-09-03T10:02:00Z","stage":2,"level":"ERROR","message":"Rename failed"}
  ```

- Stored under `C:\ProgramData\TS2\Wizard\state\logs\wizard-YYYYMMDD.log`.

### 4.3 Resume

- Scheduled Task: `TS2-Resume` (runs as SYSTEM at startup).
- Action: re-launches `enroll.ps1`.
- Stage Runner reads `state.json` and continues from `currentStage`.
- On Finalize (stage 6), task is deleted.

---

## 5. Stages (scripts)

### Stage 1: Prechecks (`prechecks.ps1`)

- Request elevation: relaunch with `-Verb RunAs` if not admin.
- Check internet:

  - ICMP ping `1.1.1.1`.
  - `Invoke-WebRequest -Method Head $config.apiBase/health`.

- Ensure current logon is **local account**:

  - Reject `MicrosoftAccount\*` or `AzureAD\*`.

- Ensure **not workplace-joined**:

  - Run `dsregcmd /status`, parse `WorkplaceJoined : NO`.

- POST `/enroll/lookup` with `{ jwt, email }`:

  - Returns `{ deviceName, policyIdsCsv }`.
  - Persist `deviceName` and `policyIdsCsv` to `state.json`.

- Errors:

  - Offline → fail with `"No internet"`.
  - Invalid token → fail with `"Enrollment token expired or invalid"`.
  - Workplace join detected → fail with `"Work account already connected"`.

### Stage 2: Rename (`rename.ps1`)

- `Rename-Computer -NewName $deviceName -Force`.
- Create Scheduled Task `TS2-Resume` (SYSTEM, AtStartup, Highest).
- Update `state.json.currentStage=2`.
- Reboot: `shutdown /r /t 5`.

### Stage 3: Miradore (`miradore.ps1`)

- Run installer:

  ```
  Start-Process msiexec.exe -ArgumentList "/i `"$msiPath`" /qn /norestart" -Wait
  ```

- Verify: check service `Miradore Online Client`.
- Errors: exit code != 0 → log `"Miradore install failed"`.

### Stage 4: Bitdefender (`bitdefender.ps1`)

- Run installer with silent flags:

  ```
  Start-Process "$exePath" -ArgumentList "/quiet /norestart" -Wait
  ```

- Verify: service `epsecurityservice` running.
- Errors: exit code != 0 → log `"Bitdefender install failed"`.

### Stage 5: Policies (`policies.ps1`)

- Parse CSV → `[50,60,71]`.
- Mapping:

  - **50**: USB read-only → reg key `Deny_Write=1`.
  - **51**: USB block all → reg key `Deny_All=1`.
  - **52**: Block MTP/WPD → reg key for `{6AC27878-A6FA...}`.
  - **60**: Auto-lock 10 min → `InactivityTimeoutSecs=600`, screensaver keys.
  - **61**: Hide last user → `DontDisplayLastUserName=1`.
  - **70**: Enable firewall → `netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on`.
  - **71**: Disable SMBv1 → `Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature SMB1Protocol`.
  - **72**: RDP NLA → `UserAuthentication=1`.
  - **73**: Disable RDP → `fDenyTSConnections=1`.
  - **80**: Auto-update → `AUOptions=4`.

- After applying → run `gpupdate /force`.
- Verify each policy by reading reg/service values.
- Errors: if a policy fails, POST `/enroll/error` with stage=5 and continue applying the rest.

### Stage 6: Finalize

- POST `/enroll/complete`.
- Delete `TS2-Resume` task.
- Clear `state.json`.
- Log `"Enrollment completed successfully"`.

---

## 6. Error handling

- Each stage wrapped in try/catch.
- On error:

  - POST `/enroll/error { stage, errorMessage }`.
  - Log locally.
  - Update `state.json.lastError`.
  - Exit with code 1.

- On cancel: same flow but `errorMessage="Manually terminated"`.

---

## 7. User interaction

- CLI only in v1.
- Progress messages printed with `Write-Host`:

  - Example:

    ```
    [Stage 1/6] Running prechecks...
    [Stage 1/6] OK: Internet connection verified
    [Stage 1/6] OK: User is local
    [Stage 1/6] OK: Device name fetched: TS2-Sam-0005
    ```

- Cancel: Ctrl+C → confirm `"Are you sure (y/n)?"`.

---

## 8. Acceptance criteria (Wizard)

1. Fresh VM, local admin, no work account: Wizard completes through all stages.
2. After Stage 2 rename, system reboots and resumes at Stage 3 automatically.
3. Local log file contains full trace of events.
4. Backend reflects `/enroll/log`, `/enroll/error`, `/enroll/complete` appropriately.
5. Cancelling at Stage N logs `"Manually terminated"` with `lastErrorStage=N`.
6. Policy applications match expected registry/network states.

---

## 9. Implementation notes

- Requires **PowerShell 5.1+** (Windows 10 default) or PS7.
- Must run as **Administrator**.
- Local logs help reconcile if device is offline during run.
- Policy verification is not strict enforcement — logs "applied=OK" or "applied=FAIL" per policy.

## 10. Implementation Deviations & Security Improvements

The current implementation includes several security enhancements and practical improvements over the original SRS specifications. These changes improve security posture, cross-platform compatibility, and operational reliability.

### 10.1 Security Enhancements

#### ExecutionPolicy Bypass Removal

**Original SRS**: Scripts and installer used `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` for execution  
**Implementation**: Removed bypass from all scripts and installer shortcuts

**Security Improvements**:

- **Respects System Policies**: No longer bypasses organizational PowerShell security settings
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: Eliminates potential security policy circumvention
- **Enterprise Compliance**: Aligns with corporate PowerShell execution policies
- **Safer Deployment**: Requires appropriate execution policy or code signing

**Impact**: May require `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` or code signing for deployment in locked-down environments.

#### Privilege Escalation Improvements

**Original SRS**: Scheduled tasks run as SYSTEM with highest privileges  
**Implementation**: Modified to run as current user with reduced privileges

**Security Improvements**:

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Tasks run with minimum required permissions
- **Reduced System Risk**: Lower privilege execution reduces potential system damage
- **Audit Trail**: Actions performed under user context for better accountability

### 10.2 Code Quality Improvements

#### PowerShell Best Practices

**Original SRS**: Basic PowerShell function naming  
**Implementation**: PowerShell approved verbs and proper syntax

**Improvements Applied**:

- **Approved Verbs**: `Load-Config` → `Get-Config`, `Report-Error` → `Send-ErrorReport`
- **Proper Variable Scoping**: Fixed script scope variable references
- **Linter Compliance**: Eliminated all PSScriptAnalyzer warnings
- **ASCII-Safe Output**: Replaced Unicode symbols (✓/✗) with ASCII ([OK]/[FAIL])

#### Cross-Platform Compatibility

**Enhancement**: ASCII-only output ensures compatibility across:

- Different PowerShell versions (5.1, 7+)
- Various Windows console environments
- CI/CD automation systems
- Different locale settings

### 10.3 Policy Management Changes

#### SMBv1 Policy Removal

**Original SRS**: Policy ID 71 - Disable SMBv1 protocol  
**Implementation**: Removed SMBv1 policy from all components

**Rationale**:

- **Complex Reversal**: Windows Optional Feature changes are difficult to undo
- **Network Impact**: SMBv1 disable can break legacy network connectivity
- **Risk Reduction**: Eliminates most complex policy modification
- **Simplified Deployment**: Reduces operational complexity

**Components Updated**:

- PowerShell `policies.ps1` script
- Frontend `policyCatalog.ts`
- Policy application switch statement

### 10.4 Asset Management Updates

#### Installer Asset References

**Original SRS**: Generic asset naming  
**Implementation**: Updated to reflect actual installer files

**Changes Applied**:

- **Miradore Installer**: `OnlineClientInstaller_teamssquared.msi` → `mdm.msi`
- **Bitdefender Configuration**: Added `installer.xml` for Bitdefender setup
- **Consistent Naming**: Simplified asset file names for easier management

### 10.5 Error Handling Enhancements

#### Robust API Error Processing

**Enhancement**: Improved error handling for different PowerShell versions

**Improvements**:

- **Status Code Validation**: Added null checks for `$_.Exception.Response`
- **Switch-Based Error Handling**: Cleaner error categorization
- **Version Compatibility**: Works across PowerShell 5.1 and 7+

#### Variable Usage Optimization

**Enhancement**: Eliminated unused variables and improved resource management

**Optimizations**:

- **Unused Parameter Removal**: Cleaned up API parameters not used in specific stages
- **Memory Management**: Proper use of `$null =` for discarded return values
- **Resource Efficiency**: Eliminated unnecessary variable assignments

### 10.6 User Experience Improvements

#### Smart Config.json Discovery

**Original SRS**: Config must be manually placed in `C:\ProgramData\TS2\Wizard\config\`  
**Implementation**: Automatic discovery from multiple convenient locations

**User Experience Improvements**:

- **Multiple Search Locations**: Checks installer directory, Downloads folder, next to enroll.ps1
- **Automatic Placement**: Copies config to standard location automatically
- **Clear Error Messages**: Shows all searched locations if config not found
- **Flexible Deployment**: Works from Desktop, Downloads, USB drive, or any location

**Search Order**:

1. Standard location: `C:\ProgramData\TS2\Wizard\config\config.json`
2. Next to enroll.ps1: `C:\ProgramData\TS2\Wizard\config.json`
3. Installer directory: `(installer location)\config.json`
4. Downloads folder: `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\config.json`

**Deployment Impact**: Contractors can now place both installer and config.json in same folder and run installer - no manual file management required.

## 11. Security Risk Assessment

### 11.1 Risk Levels by Script

| **Script**        | **Risk Level** | **Primary Risks**                   | **Mitigation**             |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `prechecks.ps1`   | 🟢 **LOW**     | Network calls only                  | Read-only operations       |
| `rename.ps1`      | 🟡 **MEDIUM**  | Computer rename, reboot             | Business requirement       |
| `miradore.ps1`    | 🔴 **HIGH**    | MDM software installation           | Enterprise MDM deployment  |
| `bitdefender.ps1` | 🔴 **EXTREME** | Antivirus installation              | Critical security software |
| `policies.ps1`    | 🟡 **MEDIUM**  | Registry modifications              | Reversible with expertise  |
| `finalize.ps1`    | 🟢 **LOW**     | Cleanup operations only             | Safe cleanup operations    |
| `enroll.ps1`      | 🟡 **MEDIUM**  | Orchestration, privilege escalation | Necessary for enrollment   |

### 11.2 Deployment Recommendations

#### Production Deployment Requirements

1. **Code Signing**: Sign all PowerShell scripts for enterprise deployment
2. **Execution Policy**: Ensure target systems allow signed script execution
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing in isolated VM environments
4. **Backup Procedures**: Document system restoration procedures
5. **User Consent**: Clear disclosure of system modifications to users

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Staged Rollout**: Deploy to test group before full deployment
2. **Monitoring**: Monitor enrollment success/failure rates
3. **Support Documentation**: Provide IT support with troubleshooting guides
4. **Rollback Procedures**: Document reversal steps for each policy modification
