This package will automatically configure your Windows device for our corporate environment.

QUICK START:

3. Follow the prompts - you'll need your Teams Squared email address

WHAT YOU NEED:
- Administrator access to your computer
- Your Teams Squared email address (e.g., john@teamsquared.io)
- Internet connection
- About 20-30 minutes

WHAT HAPPENS:
The process runs in 6 stages:

3. Miradore MDM - Installs mobile device management software
4. Bitdefender - Installs security software
5. Security Policies - Applies Windows security settings
6. Finalize - Completes enrollment and shows summary

IMPORTANT NOTES:

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- "File not found" error: Make sure all files are extracted to the same folder
- "Access denied" error: Right-click "run-enrollment.bat" and select "Run as administrator"
